# Task 1: Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Threat Landscape

## 🚩 Overview
This foundational module explores the core principles of information security, focusing on the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and the modern threat landscape. The goal was to deconstruct different threat actor profiles and analyze attack surfaces ranging from Cloud Infrastructure to Social Engineering.

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered
* **The CIA Triad:**
    * **Confidentiality:** Preventing unauthorized access (e.g., End-to-End Encryption).
    * **Integrity:** Ensuring data accuracy and preventing tampering.
    * **Availability:** Ensuring reliable access to systems and data.
* **Threat Actors:**
    * Script Kiddies vs. Nation-State Actors.
    * Hacktivists and Insider Threats.
    * Initial Access Brokers.
* **Attack Surfaces:**
    * **Cloud:** SSRF, Misconfigured S3 Buckets.
    * **Social Engineering:** Spear Phishing, Quid Pro Quo.
    * **Supply Chain:** Dependency Confusion, Update Poisoning.
    * **Identity:** Credential Stuffing, MFA Fatigue.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Cybersecurity is not merely "hacking"; it is the strategic application of controls to preserve the three properties of data (CIA) against a diverse spectrum of human and automated threats.
